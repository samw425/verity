# VERITY AI — SALES & POSITIONING COPY

> **Status**: PRD Addendum — REQUIRED FOR FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
> **Purpose**: How Verity AI should be sold, framed, and understood by users.
> **Note**: This is positioning discipline, not marketing fluff.

---

## 1. THE CORE SELL

Verity AI is NOT selling:
- Rankings
- Traffic
- "AI hacks"

Verity AI SELLS:
- Clarity and infrastructure in a changing search environment

**Businesses are paying for:**
- A clear assessment of how AI systems currently understand them
- An explanation of what data is missing or unclear
- A concrete set of files that make their business machine-readable
- Ownership of that infrastructure, without contracts or retainers

---

## 2. PRIMARY POSITIONING STATEMENT (USE VERBATIM)

**Hero Headline:**
> "Verity AI helps your business become a verifiable answer in AI-powered search."

**Supporting Sentence:**
> "We audit how AI systems interpret your business, identify missing data, and generate the infrastructure that allows models like ChatGPT and Gemini to trust and recommend you."

*This replaces vague phrases like "optimize," "rank," or "boost."*

---

## 3. WHAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR

**Section Header:** "What You're Actually Getting"

**Lead Line:**
> You're not paying for promises. You're paying for infrastructure.

**Bullet Points:**
- A deterministic audit of how visible and complete your business appears in AI-driven search
- A clear explanation of what information AI systems can and cannot see
- A set of machine-readable files that represent your business accurately
- Full ownership of those files — no contracts, no lock-in
- A timestamped baseline you can reference going forward

**Optional closer:**
> "Think of this like installing SSL, analytics, or structured data — not running ads."

---

## 4. WHY THIS EXISTS ("THE SHIFT")

**Section Header:** "Why This Matters Now"

**Copy:**
> Search is changing.
> Customers are no longer scrolling through ten blue links. They're asking AI systems for answers.
>
> When AI systems recommend a business, they rely on structured facts — not marketing copy.
>
> If your business data is incomplete, inconsistent, or unclear, AI systems hesitate.
> When AI hesitates, you don't get recommended.
>
> Verity AI exists to close that gap.

*No fear language. No urgency manipulation. Calm, factual tone.*

---

## 5. WHAT WE DO NOT DO (TRUST BUILDER)

**Section Header:** "What Verity AI Does Not Do"

**Bullet Points:**
- We do not access your Google account
- We do not modify your website
- We do not guarantee rankings or traffic
- We do not require monthly contracts
- We do not replace your agency

**Follow-up:**
> "We provide the infrastructure. You control how it's used."

*This is a conversion booster, not a blocker.*

---

## 6. AGENCY COMPARISON (WITHOUT ATTACKING AGENCIES)

**Section Header:** "How This Is Different From an Agency"

**Copy:**
> Agencies focus on ongoing optimization and marketing efforts.
>
> Verity AI focuses on one thing:
> making sure AI systems can accurately understand and verify your business.
>
> Agencies sell effort over time.
> Verity AI delivers a fixed, auditable output.
>
> Many agencies already use similar concepts internally.
> Verity AI makes that infrastructure explicit, explainable, and owned by you.

**Optional closer:**
> "Some agencies even use Verity AI as part of their process."

---

## 7. THE $197 PRICE — FRAMING

Never frame as "cheap." Frame as **one-time setup.**

**Section Header:** "Pricing"

**Copy:**
> **Entity Infrastructure Pack — $197 (One-Time)**

**Includes:**
- AI visibility audit
- Missing data diagnosis
- Custom llms.txt file
- LocalBusiness schema
- Full ownership of all generated assets

**Follow-up:**
> "This is a setup cost, not a subscription."

*Monitoring is optional and clearly separated.*

---

## 8. POST-PURCHASE FLOW (REDUCE ANXIETY)

**Section Header:** "What Happens After Checkout"

**Steps:**
1. Payment confirms automatically
2. Infrastructure files are generated for your business
3. Files appear in your dashboard
4. You install them when ready
5. AI systems update over time as they re-index information

**Closing:**
> "There is nothing else you need to buy for this to work."

---

## 9. HANDLING "DOES THIS REALLY WORK?"

**Section Header:** "Will This Change My Results?"

**Copy:**
> Verity AI does not control AI systems.
> No tool can.
>
> What Verity AI does is ensure that when AI systems evaluate your business, they have clear, consistent, machine-readable facts to work with.
>
> Most businesses don't fail because they're bad.
> They fail because their data is ambiguous.
>
> Verity AI removes that ambiguity.

---

## 10. FINAL TRUST STATEMENT (NEAR CTA)

Use this sentence near the main CTA:

> **"Verity AI is infrastructure. You either have it, or you don't."**

*That line is doing more work than any testimonial ever will.*

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- **Pages affected:** Home, Audit, Pricing, FAQ
- **Tone:** Calm, factual, confident
- **BANNED words:** "dominate," "skyrocket," "hack," "boost," "rank," "optimize"
- **Every claim must be defensible and explainable**

This is not marketing fluff. This is how you sell something new without lying.
